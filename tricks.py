#Iterate through reversed list and 

for index, element in reversed(enumerate(d)):
    #iterate through a reversed list and print the index, elemnet after reversed

for index, element in reversed(list(enumerate(d))):
    #iterate through a reversed list and print the original index, element before reversing

#when iterating through some loop and accessing indexes of array elemnets
#have the iterator variable = the current iteration, it becomes simpler to think about
