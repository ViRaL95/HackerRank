In order to store an element it takes o(n) time
Insertion into an array takes 0(1) if the array has available space, if the array is filled we create a new larger array usually twice the size and then we have to copy the elements of the old array into this new array this is now 0(n)
Removal of an elment from an array takes 0(n) time because we must shift elements to the left
